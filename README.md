# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab
This project sets up a basic Security Operations Center (SOC) in Azure using a honeypot VM to attract attackers and forward security logs to a central SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk) for analysis. It provides hands-on experience with real-world cyber threats, log management, and security monitoring.
