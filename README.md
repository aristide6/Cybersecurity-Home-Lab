# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab
📌 Project Overview
This project sets up a basic Security Operations Center (SOC) in Azure using a honeypot VM to attract attackers and forward security logs to a central SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk) for analysis. It provides hands-on experience with real-world cyber threats, log management, and security monitoring.
🚀 Key Features
✅ Azure Virtual Machine as a honeypot (Windows/Ubuntu)
✅ Log Collection & Forwarding using Azure Log Analytics
✅ Microsoft Sentinel / Splunk integration for SIEM monitoring
✅ Failed login analysis & attack detection
✅ Real-time attack map visualization
🔧 Setup Steps
1️⃣ Create an Azure VM (Windows/Ubuntu) and expose it to the internet.
2️⃣ Enable logging and forward logs to Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
3️⃣ Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel / Splunk for security monitoring.
4️⃣ Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) or Splunk queries to analyze attacks.
5️⃣ Build dashboards & attack maps for real-time insights.
